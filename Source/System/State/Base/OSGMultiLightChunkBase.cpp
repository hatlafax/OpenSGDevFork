/*! \class OSG::MultiLightChunk
    See \ref PageSystemMultiLightChunk for a description.

    This chunk represents a number of lights that are exposed to shader code
    in form of a buffer in OpenGL std430 layout format.
    A shader, binding a shader storage block to the very same binding point, 
    is expected to respect the corresponding block layout. The layout is regulated
    by the feature field of the chunk. If a feature is not set the corresponding struct
    entries are omitted. The feature attribute is protected, but getter and setters for 
    each feature are publicly provided.

    The following features are supported:

    HAS_LIGHT_SPACE_FROM_WORLD_SPACE_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matLSFromWS attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matLSFromWS;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_WORLD_SPACE_FROM_LIGHT_SPACE_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matWSFromLS attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matWSFromLS;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_LIGHT_SPACE_FROM_EYE_SPACE_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matLSFromES attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matLSFromES;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    Attention: If this flag is set the light shader storage block has to
    be updated with every redraw operation.

    HAS_EYE_SPACE_FROM_LIGHT_SPACE_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matESFromLS attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matESFromLS;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    Attention: If this flag is set the light shader storage block has to
    be updated with every redraw operation.

    HAS_PROJECTION_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matProjection attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matProjection;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    Implicitely set the hasProjection flag.

    HAS_INV_PROJECTION_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matInvProjection attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matInvProjection;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    Implicitely set the hasProjection flag.

    HAS_PROJECTION_LIGHT_SPACE_FROM_WORLD_SPACE_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matProjLSFromWS attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matProjLSFromWS;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    Implicitely set the hasProjection flag.

    HAS_INV_PROJECTION_LIGHT_SPACE_FROM_WORLD_SPACE_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matInvProjLSFromWS attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matInvProjLSFromWS;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    Implicitely set the hasProjection flag.

    HAS_PROJECTION_LIGHT_SPACE_FROM_EYE_SPACE_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matProjLSFromES attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matProjLSFromES;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    Implicitely set the hasProjection flag.

    HAS_INV_PROJECTION_LIGHT_SPACE_FROM_EYE_SPACE_MATRIX
    This flag determines if the matInvProjLSFromES attribute is part of 
    the shader storage block, i.e. if the "mat4  matInvProjLSFromES;" 
    entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    Implicitely set the hasProjection flag.

    HAS_INTENSITY
    This flag determines if the color intensity attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "vec3 intensity;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_SEPARATE_INTENSITIES
    This flag determines if the color intensity attributes are part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "vec3  Ia;", "vec3  Id;" and "vec3 Is;" entries are contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_ATTENUATION
    This flag determines if the attenuation attributes are part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float constantAttenuation;", "float linearAttenuation;" and "float quadraticAttenuation;"
    entries are contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_DECAY_ATTENUATION
    This flag determines if the attenuation decay attribute  is also part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float decayAttenuation" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    AUTO_CALC_RANGES
    If this flag is active and the lights have attenuations, then the cut on and cut off ranges
    are automatically calculated. They are, however, not provided automatically to the shader.
    For that, you have to set the hasRangeCutOn and hasRangeCutOff flags, respectively.

    HAS_RANGE_CUT_ON
    This flag determines if the rangeCutOn attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float rangeCutOn;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_RANGE_CUT_OFF
    This flag determines if the hasRangeCutOff attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float hasRangeCutOff;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_RANGE_NEAR_ZONE
    This flag determines if the hasRangeNearZone attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float hasRangeNearZone;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_RANGE_FAR_ZONE
    This flag determines if the hasRangeFarZone attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float hasRangeFarZone;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_SPOTLIGHT_ANGLE
    This flag determines if the spot light angle attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float spotlightAngle;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    If neither this flag nor the hasCosSpotlightAngle flag is true, then the hasCosSpotlightAngle 
    flag is treated as if it has value true.

    HAS_COS_SPOTLIGHT_ANGLE
    This flag determines if the cosine spot light angle attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float cosSpotlightAngle;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    If neither this flag nor the hasSpotlightAngle flag is true, then this flag is treated as if it 
    has value true.

    HAS_SPOTLIGHT_EXPONENT
    This flag determines if the spot expenent attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float spotlightExponent;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_SPOTLIGHT_PENUMBRA_ANGLE
    This flag determines if the spot penumbra angle attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float cosPenumbraCone;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_SPOTLIGHT_PENUMBRA_FACTOR
    This flag determines if the spot penumbra angle attribute is part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float cosPenumbraCone;" entry is contained in the shader struct for the Light. This flag
    additionally, determines that the penumbra angle is calculated from the spot light cone angle.

    HAS_SPOTLIGHT_PENUMBRA_FROSTBITE
    This flag determines if the spot light attributes are given in the Frostbite optimized model in the 
    shader storage block, i.e. if the "float spotScale;"  and "float spotOffset;" entries are contained
    in the shader struct for the Light.

    HAS_CINEMA_LIGHT
    This flag determines if the cinema light attributes are part of the shader storage block, i.e.
    if the "float innerSuperEllipsesWidth;", ... entries are contained in the shader struct for the Light.
    If true this flag overrides the hasRangeCutOn, hasRangeCutOff, hasRangeNearZone and hasRangeFarZone
    flags, because cinema lights are described the corresponding attributes.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superellipse

    HAS_SHADOW
    This flag determines if the multi light supports shadowing. Is set to true the boolean
    shadow flag, the shadowIntensity and the shadow index are added to the light struct.

    HAS_GLOBAL_AMBIENT_INTENSITY
    This flag determines if the multi light supports a global ambient light state, i.e. if a vec3 global color
    entry 'ambientLight' exists in the light buffer which is to be added to the single light ambient intensities.

    HAS_LENGTH_FACTOR
    This flag determines if the multi light supports a global length factor light state, i.e. if a float 'lengthFactor'
    exists in the light buffer which is used for distance attenuation calculations.

    HAS_PROJECTION
    This flag determines if the multi light contains a projection matrix for each light, that is whether
    storage is provided for the projection matrix. It does not decide whether a struct entry for the light
    in the shader is generated. For that use the dedicated hasProjectionMatrix, hasInvProjectionMatrix,
    hasProjectionLightSpaceFromWorldSpaceMatrix, hasInvProjectionLightSpaceFromWorldSpaceMatrix,
    hasProjectionLightSpaceFromEyeSpaceMatrix, hasInvProjectionLightSpaceFromEyeSpaceMatrix
    flags. Usage of these, however, implicitely set this hasProjection flag.
    Additionally, the projection matrix is not automatically calculated. That is the duty of the user of the
    chunk. Typically, the multi light shadow stage does take responsibiltiy for the proper calculation and
    setting the projection matrix.

    EYE_SPACE
    The lights position and direction are transformed to eye space before loading into the shader. 
    On default they are provided in world space.

    The following code features are supported:
    CODE_DISTANCE_ATTENUATION_CLASSIC
    The classic OpenGL attenuation function is added to the light code snippet.

    CODE_DISTANCE_ATTENUATION_PHYSICAL
    A physically based attenuation function is added to the light code snippet.

    CODE_DISTANCE_ATTENUATION_DECAY
    A physically based attenuation function is added to the light code snippet.
    An additional decay parameter is used by the function.

    CODE_DISTANCE_ATTENUATION_MIX_PHYSICAL
    A physically based attenuation function is added to the light code snippet that
    also respect the classic OpenGL attenuation parameters.

    CODE_DISTANCE_ATTENUATION_MIX_DECAY
    A physically based attenuation function is added to the light code snippet that
    also respect the classic OpenGL attenuation parameters.
    An additional decay parameter is used by the function.

    CODE_DISTANCE_ATTENUATION_SMOOTH_HERMITE
    An attenuation function based on Hermitian smoothing is added to the light code snippet.

    CODE_SPOT_ATTENUATION_CLASSIC
    The classic OpenGL spot attenuation function is added to the light code snippet.
    This model uses the cosine cutoff angle and the spot exponent parameter.

    CODE_SPOT_ATTENUATION_SMOOTH_HERMITE
    A spot attenuation function based on Hermitian smoothing is added to the light code snippet.
    This model uses the cosine cutoff angle.

    CODE_SPOT_ATTENUATION_SMOOTH_HERMITE_2
    A spot attenuation function based on Hermitian smoothing is added to the light code snippet.
    This model uses the cosine cutoff angle and the cosine penumbra angle.

    CODE_SPOT_ATTENUATION_FROSTBITE
    A spot attenuation function based in accodrance to the Frostbite engine model.
    This optimized model uses a scale factor and an offset value.
    scale  := 1.0f / max (0.001f, (penumbraCos  - coneCos));
    offset := -coneCos * scale;

    Following is the light structure shown that is valid if all layout features are activated. Usually,
    one is working only with a part of these members. Some members are expected to be set by the application
    programmer and some are set by internal machinery of OpenSG.

    struct GlobalLight
    {
    vec3  ambientIntensity;
    }

    struct Light
    {
    mat4  matLSFromWS;
    mat4  matWSFromLS;
    mat4  matLSFromES;
    mat4  matESFromLS;
    mat4  matProjection;
    mat4  matInvProjection;
    mat4  matProjLSFromWS;
    mat4  matInvProjLSFromWS;
    mat4  matProjLSFromES;
    mat4  matInvProjLSFromES;
    vec3  position;
    vec3  direction;
    vec3  ambientIntensity;
    vec3  diffuseIntensity;
    vec3  specularIntensity;
    vec3  intensity;
    float constantAttenuation;
    float linearAttenuation;
    float quadraticAttenuation;
    float decayAttenuation;
    float lengthFactor;
    float rangeCutOn;
    float rangeCutOff;
    float rangeNearZone;
    float rangeFarZone;
    float cosSpotlightAngle;
    float tanSpotlightAngle;
    float spotlightAngle;
    float spotlightExponent;
    float spotlightScale;
    float spotlightOffset;
    float cosSpotlightPenumbraAngle;
    float innerSuperEllipsesWidth;
    float innerSuperEllipsesHeight;
    float outerSuperEllipsesWidth;
    float outerSuperEllipsesHeight;
    float superEllipsesRoundness;
    float superEllipsesTwist;
    int   type;
    bool  enabled;
    bool  shadow;
    int   shadowDataIndex;
    int   shadowParameterIndex;
    };

    layout (std430) buffer Lights
    {
    GlobalLight global;
    Light       light[];
    } lights;

    The chunk provides a convenient function that allows to adjust the struct layout
    for standard OpenGL lights 

    struct Light
    {
    vec3  position;
    vec3  direction;
    vec3  ambientIntensity;
    vec3  diffuseIntensity;
    vec3  specularIntensity;
    float constantAttenuation;
    float linearAttenuation;
    float quadraticAttenuation;
    float cosSpotlightAngle;
    float spotlightExponent;
    int   type;
    bool  enabled;
    };

    or for simple range lights:

    struct Light
    {
    vec3  position;
    vec3  direction;
    vec3  intensity;
    float rangeCutOff;
    float cosSpotlightAngle;
    int   type;
    bool  enabled;
    };
